# AI Agent Development using LangChain

In week six we explore LangChain, a Python framework for building agents that chain multiple language model calls and tools together.

## Outline

- building chains
- tools and plugins
- agent memory and state
- multi-step agents
- evaluation techniques
- example project
- further exploration

## 1. Building Chains
A chain is a sequence of prompts, model invocations and actions. LangChain makes it easy to connect these steps so that the output of one becomes the input of the next.

### Memory Management
Conversation memory objects store user messages and model responses. This allows an agent to maintain context over extended dialogues. Different memory types support summarization or token-limited histories.
Persistent memory classes write interactions to disk or a database so agents can resume conversations even after a restart. Summarizing memory compresses long transcripts into embeddings or key sentences to fit within model context windows.

## 2. Tools and Plugins
LangChain integrates with many tools such as web search, code execution sandboxes and vector stores. Tools are invoked by the agent when it determines additional data is needed to answer a question.

### Custom Tools
Developers can define their own tools by writing a function and registering it with the agent. Tools may access internal APIs, databases or external services.

## 3. Agent Memory and State
Agents maintain state across turns using different memory classes. Simple buffer
memory stores the full conversation while summary memory compresses old
exchanges to keep prompts short. Key-value memory can hold structured data such
as the user’s name or preferences for use in later steps.

## 4. Multi-step Agents
Complex tasks often require retrieval, reasoning and action in sequence. For example an agent might search documentation, parse the results and then compose a concise answer. LangChain provides higher-level agent classes that handle decision making and tool selection.

### Debugging and Tracing
LangChain includes verbose logging and tracing utilities. These help inspect the reasoning process of the agent and diagnose unexpected behavior.

## 5. Example Project
Build a question answering assistant that looks up information in a vector store before replying. The chain uses the following steps:
1. Receive the user question.
2. Retrieve relevant documents from a vector database.
3. Feed the documents and question to a language model.
4. Return the model’s summarized answer along with references.

### Sample Code
```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

vector_store = FAISS.load_local('docs_index')
llm = OpenAI(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo')
qa = RetrievalQA(llm=llm, retriever=vector_store.as_retriever())
response = qa.run('How do I install the package?')
print(response)
```

## 6. Evaluation Techniques
Evaluate agents by logging intermediate steps and checking whether the chosen
tools lead to correct answers. LangChain provides tracing utilities that export
JSON traces for later analysis. You can also score final answers against a test
set or human ratings.

## 7. Further Exploration
- Experiment with different chain structures such as sequential chains or parallel tool calls.
- Use the LangChain evaluation module to benchmark your agent’s performance.

By the end of week six you will be prepared to design complex LLM agents that use external tools and memory to solve real problems.

The LangChain documentation includes many advanced patterns such as ReAct-style
reasoning and planner-executor designs. Experiment with these templates to build
agents that can perform multi-step research or workflow automation.
