# LLM Solutions

The final week surveys complete solutions built with language models across different industries. We discuss deployment considerations and real-world success stories.

## 1. Conversational Systems
Chatbots and virtual assistants automate customer service and technical support. Effective systems combine retrieval (for factual accuracy) with dialogue management. Tools such as sentiment detection help tailor responses to user emotions.

## 2. Summarization and Question Answering
Organizations use LLMs to condense lengthy reports or answer natural language queries over internal documents. Combining RAG pipelines with prompt engineering yields concise, trustworthy results.

## 3. Domain Automation
In finance, language models analyze market reports and generate portfolio summaries. Healthcare applications include patient triage chatbots and medical coding assistance. In education, tutors generate practice questions and personalized feedback.

## 4. Deployment Considerations
To run these solutions at scale we need secure infrastructure, monitoring and failover plans. Choosing between cloud-hosted APIs or self-hosted models depends on latency, cost and privacy requirements. Logging and analytics help track performance over time.

## 5. Capstone Project
Students are encouraged to design a small end-to-end application incorporating retrieval, prompt engineering and an LLM agent. Presentations at the end of the course showcase the creativity and technical depth achieved during the seven weeks.
