# AI Applications

Week five focuses on integrating language models into real-world applications. We explore common patterns and discuss how to evaluate systems in production.

## 1. Application Patterns
LLMs power a variety of services including chatbots, summarization tools and knowledge extraction pipelines. We survey each of these patterns and discuss the design considerations involved.

### Chatbots and Assistants
Conversational agents require state management to maintain context across turns. Techniques such as conversation memory or storing user history in a database help create natural, continuous interactions.

### Summarization Services
Automatic summarization condenses large documents into key points. Whether abstractive or extractive, summarizers rely on well-crafted prompts and often incorporate feedback from human reviewers.

### Knowledge Extraction
Businesses use LLMs to identify entities and relationships within text. By combining extraction prompts with downstream databases, we can build structured knowledge bases from unstructured sources.

## 2. Evaluation and Feedback
Deploying an LLM-powered app is an iterative process. We should monitor metrics such as response quality, latency and user satisfaction. A/B testing different prompt templates or model parameters helps determine what works best. Collecting explicit user feedback allows continuous improvement.

### Human-in-the-Loop
In sensitive domains, humans review model outputs before final delivery. This ensures accuracy and prevents harmful content from reaching end users.

## 3. Safety Considerations
LLMs can hallucinate or produce biased text. Implement guardrails such as content filters, rate limiting and logging. Privacy is also vitalâ€”avoid sending sensitive user data to external services unless it has been properly anonymized and consent has been obtained.

## 4. Implementation Exercise
Design a simple application that integrates a chat interface with an LLM API. Track metrics such as user retention and feedback ratings. Experiment with prompt variants to improve helpfulness while maintaining safe responses.

After week five you will know how to plan and build LLM applications with a focus on evaluation, safety and user-centered design.
