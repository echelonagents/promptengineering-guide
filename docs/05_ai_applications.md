# AI Applications

Week five focuses on integrating language models into real-world applications. We explore common patterns and discuss how to evaluate systems in production.

## Outline

- application patterns
- system architecture and data pipelines
- evaluation and feedback
- safety considerations
- monitoring and logging
- implementation exercise

## 1. Application Patterns
LLMs power a variety of services including chatbots, summarization tools and knowledge extraction pipelines. We survey each of these patterns and discuss the design considerations involved.

### Chatbots and Assistants
Conversational agents require state management to maintain context across turns. Techniques such as conversation memory or storing user history in a database help create natural, continuous interactions.

### Summarization Services
Automatic summarization condenses large documents into key points. Whether abstractive or extractive, summarizers rely on well-crafted prompts and often incorporate feedback from human reviewers.

### Knowledge Extraction
Businesses use LLMs to identify entities and relationships within text. By combining extraction prompts with downstream databases, we can build structured knowledge bases from unstructured sources.

## 2. System Architecture and Data Pipelines
LLM applications often follow a microservice design. A front-end interface sends
requests to a back-end service that orchestrates calls to the language model and
any retrieval databases. Message queues or streaming systems pass conversation
history and user feedback to analytics components. Choosing whether to call a
hosted API or deploy a model locally depends on latency, cost and privacy.

### Data Schemas
Storing conversations typically involves a table of messages with columns for
timestamp, user ID and text. Vector databases may store embeddings alongside the
raw documents for retrieval.

## 3. Evaluation and Feedback
Deploying an LLM-powered app is an iterative process. We should monitor metrics such as response quality, latency and user satisfaction. A/B testing different prompt templates or model parameters helps determine what works best. Collecting explicit user feedback allows continuous improvement.

Quantitative evaluation includes measuring perplexity or other automated metrics, while qualitative studies gather insights from domain experts. Maintaining test datasets with expected answers ensures that new model versions do not regress on established functionality.

### Human-in-the-Loop
In sensitive domains, humans review model outputs before final delivery. This ensures accuracy and prevents harmful content from reaching end users.

## 4. Safety Considerations
LLMs can hallucinate or produce biased text. Implement guardrails such as content filters, rate limiting and logging. Privacy is also vitalâ€”avoid sending sensitive user data to external services unless it has been properly anonymized and consent has been obtained.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging
Production systems should log every request and response for troubleshooting and
analysis. Metrics such as response time, token usage and user satisfaction scores
help diagnose regressions. Dashboards enable operators to spot spikes in latency
or abnormal output.

## 6. Implementation Exercise
Design a simple application that integrates a chat interface with an LLM API. Track metrics such as user retention and feedback ratings. Experiment with prompt variants to improve helpfulness while maintaining safe responses.

### Example Code
```python
import openai

chat_history = []

def chat(question):
    chat_history.append({"role": "user", "content": question})
    resp = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=chat_history)
    answer = resp.choices[0].message.content
    chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": answer})
    return answer
```

After week five you will know how to plan and build LLM applications with a focus on evaluation, safety and user-centered design.

Thorough monitoring and iterative prompt design will ensure your applications remain reliable as models and requirements evolve.
