# Prompt Engineering Guide
This guide provides information for Prompt Engineering and working with LLMs. Each topic delves into theory, data structures and practical algorithms so you can build end‑to‑end solutions.

Each topic page includes a **Contents Outline** section at the beginning so you
can quickly navigate the material and locate key subtopics.

## Topics
The course focuses on:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- AI application development
