## 1. Prompt Design Principles
A prompt should clearly state the task and provide any needed context. Typically we include a system or persona message to guide style and tone. Explicit instructions about output format help prevent confusion.

### Guidelines
- Keep instructions concise yet specific.
- Use delimiters such as triple backticks to separate instructions from user content.
- Include examples of correct output when possible.
- Control randomness with the temperature and top‑p parameters.

## 2. Zero-shot, Few-shot and Chain-of-Thought

- **Zero-shot**: Ask the model to perform the task directly with no examples.
- **Few-shot**: Provide a handful of labeled examples within the prompt to establish the pattern.
- **Chain-of-thought**: Encourage multi-step reasoning by telling the model to explain its steps before giving the final answer.

### Self-consistency
By generating several chain-of-thought responses and voting on the most consistent outcome, we can achieve higher accuracy on complex reasoning tasks.

## 3. Using System Prompts
System prompts establish the role or persona of the assistant, such as "You are a helpful travel planner." Distinguishing between system and user prompts prevents instructions from being interpreted as user input.

### Controlling Style
We can mimic styles ranging from academic explanations to casual conversation. Including explicit style cues helps tailor the voice to the target audience.

## 4. Prompt Templates and Data Structures
Complex applications store prompts as templates with placeholders. A template may
be expressed as a Python string with `{variable}` tokens or as a structured
object containing fields for system, user and tool messages. Managing prompts as
data enables version control and automated testing.

### Example Template

```python
template = """You are a math tutor.\nQuestion: {question}\nAnswer:"""
filled = template.format(question="What is 2+2?")
```

## 5. Advanced Formatting
When output needs to be machine-readable, we can instruct the model to respond in JSON or Markdown. Using placeholders and bullet lists reduces variation in the output structure.

### Example Prompt

```
You are a concise consultant.
Answer the question using three bullet points.
Question: How can I reduce latency in a web app?
```

### Temperature and Top-p
The randomness of model output is controlled with the `temperature` and
`top_p` parameters. Lower temperature produces more deterministic responses,
while a higher value encourages creative or varied text. Nucleus sampling
(`top_p`) limits generation to the most probable tokens whose cumulative
probability is below a threshold, often producing coherent yet diverse answers.

## 6. Prompt Iteration and Evaluation
Developing a good prompt is an iterative process. Start with a clear baseline, test the output on multiple examples and refine. Automated evaluation frameworks such as OpenAI’s prompt engineering tools or the `langchain` evaluator can assist with this process.

Evaluation often measures metrics like exact match on benchmark tasks or user satisfaction collected through ratings. Tracking how prompts perform across multiple criteria helps identify trade-offs between brevity, accuracy and style. Version control of prompts enables A/B testing and regression checks.

## 7. Automated Optimization
Tools such as prompt matrices and evolutionary algorithms can automatically test
variations of a base prompt. By measuring accuracy or user satisfaction we can
select the best-performing template. This approach scales when manual iteration
becomes impractical.

One common strategy is to randomly sample variations of wording or ordering within a prompt and score them with a reference answer. Gradient-free optimization methods such as Bayesian search can then converge on high-performing prompts with fewer trials.

## 8. Practical Exercise: Summarization and data extraction pipeline
Design prompts for a summarization tool and a data extraction pipeline. Experiment with different temperature settings and evaluate how formatting instructions affect the consistency of the model’s responses.

## 9. Continuous improvement
Continuous improvement is key. Save successful prompts in a library and track
their performance on real user queries. Over time these prompt libraries become
valuable assets that accelerate development of new LLM applications.
