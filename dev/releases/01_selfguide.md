For context, refer to the navigation guide in `mkdocs.yml`, landing page `/docs/index.md` and the release doc `/dev/releases/01_selfguide`

situation
the current topic pages are too general, and not sufficient level of detail to properly cover the theory and application of the topics

your task
- scope: all topic pages
    - using NLP page `/docs/01_natural_language_processing.md` as a guide, flesh out and develop the remaining pages to this level of detail and coverage of the topics, including theory development, data structures, algorithms and practical examples
- Work in iterative cycles of developing the outline for each page, and then filling in the contents until you reach a level of detail of a course content of a text book or lecture notes.  
- update your activity as a timestamped session log in the ## Session logs section of the release doc in the section ### Contents development [Codex] 2025-07-06 <HH>:<MM> 
- create a PR with the edits to the landing page and your session log

### NLP [Codex] 2025-07-06 15:47

- Added contents outline sections to all topic pages
- Expanded the Natural Language Processing page with fundamental theory and
  machine learning sections
- Updated the landing page to mention outlines for each topic
